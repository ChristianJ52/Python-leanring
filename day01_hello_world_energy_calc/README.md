# Day 1 — Hello World & Energy Calculator

My first step in this learning journey.  
I started with a simple **Hello World** program to get familiar with Python syntax, and then built a basic **Energy Cost Calculator**.

## What it does
### 1. Hello World
- Prints `"Hello, World!"` to the console.  
- First time running and executing Python successfully.  

### 2. Energy Cost Calculator
- Asks the user to enter:
  - Energy used (kWh)  
  - Cost per kWh (€)  
- Calculates:  
  Total Cost = Energy Used × Cost per kWh  
- Displays the result rounded to 2 decimal places.

## What I learned
- How to write and run a Python script.  
- How to use the `print()` function.  
- Taking user input with `input()` and converting strings to numbers with `float()`.  
- Formatting results with f-strings (e.g., `:.2f` for 2 decimal places).
