# Learning Journey
Welcome to my coding journey!  
I’m using this repository as a coding journal to document my Python practice.  
Each day I add new exercises or projects, along with explanations of how the code works and what I learned.  
This is a continuous journey not a challenge with an end date and I’ll keep building on it throughout college and beyond.

 -Repo Structure
Each day has its own folder and Python file(s).  
For example:

- **Day 1** → Hello World & Energy Calculator  
- **Day 2** → Building Engineering Tool  
- **Day 3** → Multi-Tool Upgrade  
- **Day 4** → Multi-Tool with Reporting & Visualization  
- **Day 5** → Building Portfolio Manager  

- *(and continuing… no fixed end date — just ongoing progress)*
